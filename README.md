# Pomodoro

This project is a timer that uses the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work down into intervals which are separated by small breaks. With this timer, you can easily manage your time and increase your productivity by taking short breaks between your work sessions.

## Features
- Users can set a timer for work sessions from 15 to 60 minutes.
- The timer has a neomorphic design
- Users are given a taskslist where they can add and edit tasks

## Approach

One notable feature of the timer is its neomorphic design. Neumorphism is a design trend that creates a realistic, three-dimensional appearance by using light and shadow effects. This design choice enhances the visual appeal of the timer and provides a modern and sleek look.

## Stack
- React.js
- SCSS

## Optimizations

Adding notification alerts: Incorporating a feature that sends notifications or alerts when a work session or break ends could help users stay on track and manage their time more effectively.
Task synchronization: Allowing users to sync their tasks with other productivity tools or platforms, such as project management software or calendars, would provide a more seamless experience and enable better organization.
Pomodoro history and analytics: Implementing a feature that tracks and displays Pomodoro history and productivity statistics, such as the number of completed Pomodoros and average session length, could provide valuable insights and motivate users to improve their productivity over time.
